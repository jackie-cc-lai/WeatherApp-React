## Weather App React Frontend

The app is generated via create react app

## Component Tree
 - App
   - Navbar
   - Main
     - Current Weather Component
     - Forecast Weather Table

## Auxiliary
 - Request/Axios service for initial check/auth with service, and request for weather/look up city (still not working)
 
 ## TODO
  - UI - UI's still a mess
  - Look into using hooks/other methods over using callbacks via props. Using props as a callback feels weird and dangerous
